    "Recommender systems were first mentioned in a technical report as a \"digital bookshelf\" in 1990 by Jussi Karlgren at Columbia University,[13] and implemented at scale and worked through in technical reports and publications from 1994 onwards by Jussi Karlgren, then at SICS,[14] [15] and research groups led by Pattie Maes at MIT,[16] Will Hill at Bellcore,[17] and Paul Resnick, also at MIT[18] [19] whose work with GroupLens was awarded the 2010 ACM Software Systems Award.\n",
    "\n",
    "Montaner provided the first overview of recommender systems from an intelligent agent perspective.[20] Adomavicius provided a new, alternate overview of recommender systems.[21] Herlocker provides an additional overview of evaluation techniques for recommender systems,[22] and Beel et al. discussed the problems of offline evaluations.[23] Beel et al. have also provided literature surveys on available research paper recommender systems and existing challenges.[24][25][26]  (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recommender_system#cite_note-13)\n"
